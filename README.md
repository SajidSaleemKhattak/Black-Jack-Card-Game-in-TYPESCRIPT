# TypeScript Practice Project

This is a basic TypeScript project setup with common development tools and configurations.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server with hot-reload
- `npm run build`: Build the TypeScript code to JavaScript
- `npm start`: Run the built JavaScript code
- `npm run watch`: Watch for changes and compile TypeScript in real-time

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source TypeScript files
- `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript files (created after build)
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts
